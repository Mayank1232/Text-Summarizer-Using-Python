# Text-Summarizer-Using-Python

In this project we build an website application which is very useful for summarising the text. Text can be choose from any website. Using that link of that website we generate a text.

Technology used: 
1. Python (Language)
2. Beautiful Soap (For Scraping)
3. Flask (for backend to develop an website)
